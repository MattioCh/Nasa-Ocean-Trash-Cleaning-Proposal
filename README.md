# Nasa-Ocean-Trash-Cleaning-Proposal

SUSTAINABLE FAST CLEANER
Introduction and Problem Recognised:
We recognised that there are existing solutions that have been introduced in the media. One of the most famous one is "the Ocean Cleanup." However, we have realised that the current solution were not efficient enough to catch up how fast human are producing these trash into the ocean. Also, the process of cleaning itself actually used up a lot of energy. Therefore, we have come up this solution that will fix these issues.

Our Solution:

1. We will install drones on the existing ocean cleaner. The drone will inspect the nearby trash and send images to the computing device on the boat. 
2. We will also extract real-time data from Nasa to find the region where trash is most concentrated at. We then use an algorithm to optimise a best route for the boat that would collect the trash most efficiently. Some boats would also be signalled to allocate themselves to some specific location where the concentration of trash is high so that the trash collecting process would be more efficient.

3. Using the strong oxidising property of supercritical water, we will install a 1 x 1 x1 meter3 reactor on one boat out of two. The reactor would allow the production of supercritical water and the supercritical could at the same time, react with plastics and turn plastics into diesel oil.

(due to some technical issue, we weren't able to upload images or edit the text as we want to on this editor. Therefore, this is our presentation link that will better explain our project.)
